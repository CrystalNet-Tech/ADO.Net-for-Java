# ADO.Net for Java
The code examples in this repository are powered by the dotNet4Java .Net Framework class library for Java which is the Java equivalent of the .Net Framework Class Library (which provides the system functionality in the .NET Framework as it has various classes, data types, interfaces, etc. to perform multiple functions and build different types of applications such as desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, etc.).
The code listings on this repository demonstrate how to retrieve data from a database by using ADO.NET from Java:

ADO.NET data providers:
* SqlClient (system.data.sqlClient package)
* OleDb (system.data.oleDb package)
* Odbc (system.data.odbc package)
* OracleClient (system.data.oracleClient package)

ADO.NET Entity Framework:
* EntityClient (system.data.entityclient package)
