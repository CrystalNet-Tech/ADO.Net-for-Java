The code in this example assumes that you can connect to the Northwind sample database on Microsoft SQL Server. The code creates a SqlCommand to select rows from the Products table, adding a SqlParameter to restrict the results to rows with a UnitPrice greater than the specified parameter value, in this case 5. The SqlConnection is opened inside a using block, which ensures that resources are closed and disposed when the code exits. The code executes the command by using a SqlDataReader, and displays the results in the console window.
